# BASKETBALL STATS LEAGUE MANAGER

## Prerequisites:

[NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

[PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)

[XAMPP for PHP host](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)

## Steps to setup development enviroment
1. Install all the prereqs.
1. Pull the repository, type 'npm install' and 'npm start' to start the frontend. You should only need to do 'npm install' on startup.
1. The files in the folder "php-files" are to be copied into the XAMPP htdocs in a folder named 'nba'. This is important so that the frontend can connect to the backend.
1. Setup MYSQL server (Use the same DB username/password hardcoded in php files for simplicity), and import mysql dump folder found in 'database-dump'. I suggest using MySQL Workbench.
